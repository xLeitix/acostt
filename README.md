## Software Developer Targeted Performance and Cost Management for Autonomic Cloud Applications
Scale-out cloud services, such as Netflix or Microsoft Bing, often consist of hundreds of independent microservices running on thousands of virtual machines or containers. Deployment automation and self-management (e.g., through circuit breakers or autoscaling) are fundamental to the management of such systems. However, these autonomic principles have made testing and ops cost estimation at development time challenging. In this PhD project, the goal is to combine empirical and experimental research methods to devise approaches to test the autonomic behavior of changes to a cloud application prior to deployment. Further, models shall be investigated to estimate the impact of such changes on the financial costs of deployment, allowing to quantify the monetary costs of development decisions.
