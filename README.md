# Software Developer Targeted Performance and Cost Management for Autonomic Cloud Applications (ACOSTT)

*This is a project announcement for a fully sponsored PhD under the supervision of [Dr. Philipp Leitner](http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/leitner.html)*.

## Project Summary

Scale-out cloud services, such as Netflix or Microsoft Bing, often consist of hundreds of independent microservices running on thousands of virtual machines or containers. Deployment automation and self-management (e.g., through circuit breakers or autoscaling) are fundamental to the management of such systems. However, these autonomic principles have made testing and operations cost estimation at development time challenging. In this PhD project, the goal is to combine empirical and experimental research methods to devise approaches to test the autonomic behavior of changes to a cloud application prior to deployment. Further, models shall be investigated to estimate the impact of such changes on the financial costs of deployment, allowing to quantify the monetary costs of development decisions.

## Expected Outcomes

As with any PhD project, the detailed goals are not specified upfront. Instead, it will be one of your tasks as a PhD student to find the most interesting and relevant open challenges (in the broader scope of performance testing and cost estimation for autonomic cloud apps) that you can (and want to!) address during your PhD. However, generally speaking, as a PhD student in the larger field of software technologies, you will be asked to produce three kinds of scientific outcomes:

* New empirical knowledge, for instance through interview or survey studies, software repository mining, or mapping studies.
* New concepts, approaches, techniques, or methodologies. These need to be developed following the principles of [design science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_science_research), and require extensive scientific evaluation (e.g., through controlled studies or other experiments).
* Proof-of-concept implementations of the above in concrete prototypes and tools, which we usually make available as open source software.

All of these are to be communicated to other scientists through high-quality publications. We typically target a mixture of top-ranked and smaller, more specialized venues. As a young scientist, you will be judged based on your published work, so writing regularly will quickly become a non-optional part of your work routine.

The best PhD theses in our field have elements of all three of the above. This also means that you should have fairly broad interests and be willing to study and apply a vast array of different scientific methodologies, spanning from interviewing and survey research over statistical analysis to programming and system development.
