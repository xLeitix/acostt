# Software Developer Targeted Performance and Cost Management for Autonomic Cloud Applications (ACOSTT)

*This is a project announcement for a fully sponsored PhD under the advisory of [Dr. Philipp Leitner](http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/leitner.html)*.

## Project Summary

Scale-out cloud services, such as Netflix or Microsoft Bing, often consist of hundreds of independent microservices running on thousands of virtual machines or containers. Deployment automation and self-management (e.g., through circuit breakers or autoscaling) are fundamental to the management of such systems. However, these autonomic principles have made testing and operations cost estimation at development time challenging. In this PhD project, the goal is to combine empirical and experimental research methods to devise approaches to test the autonomic behavior of changes to a cloud application prior to deployment. Further, models shall be investigated to estimate the impact of such changes on the financial costs of deployment, allowing to quantify the monetary costs of development decisions.

## Expected Outcomes

As with any PhD project, the detailed goals are not specified upfront. Instead, it will be one of your tasks as a PhD student to find the most interesting and relevant open challenges (in the broader scope of performance testing and cost estimation for autonomic cloud apps) that you can (and want to!) address during your PhD. However, generally speaking, as a PhD student in the larger field of software technologies, you will be asked to produce three kinds of scientific outcomes:

* New empirical knowledge, for instance through interview or survey studies, software repository mining, or mapping studies.
* New concepts, approaches, techniques, or methodologies. These need to be developed following the principles of [design science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_science_research), and require extensive scientific evaluation (e.g., through controlled studies or other experiments).
* Proof-of-concept implementations of the above in concrete prototypes and tools, which we usually make available as open source software.

All of these are to be communicated to other scientists through high-quality publications. We typically target a mixture of top-ranked and smaller, more specialized venues. As a young scientist, you will be judged based on your published work, so writing regularly will quickly become a non-optional part of your work routine.

The best PhD theses in our field have elements of all three of the above. This also means that you should have fairly broad interests and be willing to study and apply a vast array of different scientific methodologies, spanning from interviewing and survey research over statistical analysis to programming and system development.

## Related Publications

The best way to find out what to expect when doing your PhD in this area is by looking at publications of my previous or current students (or other students that I collaborate with). Below you find a few recent, representative examples:

## Support You Will Get

As part of your PhD, you will be a salaried employee at the [Chalmers University of Technology](http://www.chalmers.se). You will be part of the [Software Engineering division](http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/organisation/se). Full funding for your PhD will be provided. This includes not only your salary, but also sufficient funds to cover equipment, travels to conferences, and other costs of doing the project.

In addition to frequent meetings with your advisor, you will also be embedded in a closely-knit and successful research group operating in Sweden and Switzerland, with collaborators all over Europe and the world.

## Advisor
This project is advised by [Dr. Philipp Leitner](http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/leitner.html). Philipp is currently in the process of relocating from University of Zurich to Gothenburg. When the project launches, Philipp will have moved to Sweden and will be fulltime faculty at Chalmers. *It is not possible to enroll at University of Zurich for this project.*
